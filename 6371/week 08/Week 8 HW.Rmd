```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(scales)
df <- read_csv("Documents/DataScience@SMU/MSDS-6371-Stat-Foundations/Unit 8/Baseball_Data.csv")
```

## Initial Scatterplot

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Payroll, Wins)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  labs(title = "Baseball Payroll vs. Wins",
       x = "Payroll ($ millions)",
       caption = "Matt Farrow, Week 8 Homework\ndata from 2010 season") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  NULL
```

## Correlation Between Payroll & Wins

```{r correlation}
cor.test(df$Payroll, df$Wins)
```

## Add Correlation to Plot

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Payroll, Wins)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  labs(title = "Baseball Payroll vs. Wins",
       x = "Payroll ($ millions)",
       caption = "Matt Farrow, Week 8 Homework\ndata from 2010 season") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  NULL
```

## Remove San Diego 

San Diego (SD) has a payroll of $38 million, yet SD has 90 wins â€“ more than Boston does (with a payroll of $162 million). Delete SD from the data and rerun the analysis (scatter plot and correlation value). How does the correlation change?  

```{r}
df_less_SD <- df %>% 
  filter(TEAM != "SD")
```

## Run Correlation

```{r}
cor.test(df_less_SD$Payroll, df_less_SD$Wins)
```

## Scatterplot

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_less_SD %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Payroll, Wins)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  labs(title = "Baseball Payroll vs. Wins",
       subtitle = "Excludes San Diego (Payroll: $38M, Wins: 90)",
       x = "Payroll ($ millions)",
       caption = "Matt Farrow, Week 8 Homework\ndata from 2010 season") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  NULL

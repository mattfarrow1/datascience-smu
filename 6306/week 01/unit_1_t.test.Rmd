```

The following are ages of 7 randomly chosen patrons seen leaving the Beach Comber in South Mission Beach at 7pm! We assume that the data come from a normal distribution and would like to test the claim that the mean age of the distribution of Comber patrons is different than 21. Conduct a 6-step hypothesis test to test this claim.  

```{r}
ages <- c(25, 19, 37, 29, 40, 28, 31)
```

## Hypothesis Test

### 1. NULL & Alternative Hypothesis

$H_0: \bar{x} = 21$  
$H_a: \bar{x} â‰  21$

### 2. Draw and Shade

```{r echo=FALSE}

    text(t_calc + 0.5, 0.2, t_calc, col = "red")
  }
  axis(1, at=at, labels=labels)
}

#The above defines the function shade. To use it, you must call it. More examples are in the comments above.
shade(6, 0.05, 21, sides = "both")
```

```{r}
# Run Two-Sided t-test
t.test(ages, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 21)
```

### 3. t-Value

t = 3.3093

### 4. p-Value

p = 0.01622

### 5. Decision

Reject $H_0$.

### 6. Conclusion

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true mean age of patrons at the Beachcomber at 7pm is not equal to 21 (p-value = 0.01622 from a t-test). Because this sample was only drawn at 7pm, the results cannot be applied to the bar at all times.

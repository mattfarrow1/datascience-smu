## Question 1: Model Interpretation

Using the cars.csv dataset,

### Fit the Model $mpg = Œ≤_0 + Œ≤_1(Weight) + ùúÄ$

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Read in the data
cars <- read_csv(here::here("6306", "week 10", "cars.csv"))

# Create the model
cars_model <- lm(MPG ~ Weight, data = cars)

# Generate the model summary
summary(cars_model)
```

### 6-Step Hypothesis Test

Conduct a 6-step hypothesis test of the slope. That is, test the claim that the slope is significantly different from zero. Show all 6 steps and quantify your uncertainty by including a 95% confidence interval for the slope.

1. NULL & Alternative Hypothesis

  - $H_0: Œ≤_0 = 0$
  - $H_a: Œ≤_o ‚â† 0$
  
2. Find the critical values; draw and shade

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Critical values
qt(1-0.05, 392)

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("6306", "week 10", "norm.gif"))
```

3. Calculate the t-statistic

  - -29.73
  
4. Calculate the p-value

  - <2e-16

5. Make a decision

  - Reject the NULL hypothesis

6. Write a clear conclusion

  - There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the slope is different than 0 (p-value = 2e-16). 95% confidence interval (-0.0082, -0.0072).

### 

Describe the relationship between miles per gallon and the weight of the car by interpreting the slope parameter. Again, be sure and include a 95% confidence interval in your interpretation.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(cars_model)
confint(cars_model)
```

$MPG = 46.2734 - 0.0077(Weight)$

Each one unit increase in MPG corresponds with a 0.0077 unit decrease in weight of the car; 95% confidence interval (-0.0082, -0.0072).

## Question 2: Leave One Out Cross Validation

Using the cars.csv, conduct an internal n-fold (leave one out) cross validation of the following SLR models:

1. Model 1:  $mpg = Œ≤_0 + Œ≤_1(Weight) + ùúÄ$  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(caret)

train(MPG ~ Weight, method = "lm", data = cars, trControl = trainControl(method = "LOOCV"))
```

2. Model 2:  $mpg = Œ≤_0 + Œ≤_1(Weight) + Œ≤_2(Weight)^2 + ùúÄ$  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
train(MPG ~ Weight + I(Weight^2), method = "lm", data = cars, trControl = trainControl(method = "LOOCV"))
```

3. Which model is favored by this cross validation?  

  - Model 2 is favored by cross-validation.

4. Describe the relationship between miles per gallon and the weight of the car (if it has changed) (again making sure to quantify any uncertainty you may have.) 

5. Use the favored model to estimate the mean mpg of cars that weigh 2000 lbs.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Using model 2 let's estimate the mean mpg of the sub-population of cars that weigh 2000lbs
fit <- lm(MPG ~ Weight + I(Weight^2), data = cars)
car2000 <- data.frame(Weight = 2000)
car2000_conf <- predict(fit, newdata = car2000, interval = "confidence")
car2000_conf

# Using model 2 let's estimate the mpg of an individual car that weighs 2000lbs
fit <- lm(MPG ~ Weight + I(Weight^2), data = cars)
car2000 <- data.frame(Weight = 2000)
car2000_pred <- predict(fit, newdata = car2000, interval = "prediction")
car2000_pred

# Plot predicted mean on our graph
cars %>% ggplot(aes(x = Weight, y = MPG)) +
  geom_point() +
  # geom_line(data = cars, aes(x = Weight, y = car2000_pred, col = "red", size = 1)) +
  ggtitle("LR Model: Weight + Weight^2 vs MPG") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Predicted") +
  geom_point(aes(x = 2000, y = floor(car2000_pred[1])), color = "blue", shape = "square", size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Question 3: Impute Values

Using the cars.csv dataset, We would like to assess the relationship (interpret slope parameter) between mpg and horsepower.  Notice that some of the horsepower values are missing.  

1. Impute (predict and insert) the missing horsepower values by fitting a regression model. 
2. You may use any of the variables as regressors EXCEPT for MPG (since we will later be using horsepower to predict mpg.) 
3. Assess the relationship between the mpg and the slope.  Make sure and include estimates of your uncertainty (i.e. Confidence intervals.) 
4. Use your model and imputed data to estimate the mean mpg for a car with 250 horsepower. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# How many missing values?
colSums(is.na(cars))
missingIdx <- which(is.na(cars$Horsepower))

# Look at the rows with missing values
cars %>% filter(is.na(Horsepower))

# Look at variable relationships
cars %>% 
  select(-c(1:2)) %>% 
  ggpairs() +
  theme_minimal()

# Look at horsepower and acceleration
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Horsepower, Acceleration)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between horsepower and acceleration") +
  theme_ipsum()

# Fit a model using acceleration
fit <- lm(Horsepower ~ Acceleration, data = cars)
summary(fit)
confint(fit)

# Predict missing horsepower values using acceleration
cars_predict <- predict(fit, newdata = tibble(Acceleration = c(cars[missingIdx[1], ]$Acceleration,
                                                               cars[missingIdx[2], ]$Acceleration)))

# Add predictions to cars
cars[missingIdx[1], ]$Horsepower <- cars_predict[1]
cars[missingIdx[2], ]$Horsepower <- cars_predict[2]

# Look at the relationship with imputed values
# Look at horsepower and acceleration
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Horsepower, Acceleration)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between horsepower and acceleration") +
  theme_ipsum()

# Re-run the model
fit <- lm(Horsepower ~ Acceleration, data = cars)
summary(fit)
confint(fit)

# MSE
mean(cars$Horsepower - (predict(cars_model)^2))

# Predict mean mpg for car with 250 HP
fit <- lm(MPG ~ Horsepower, data = cars)
horse_predict <-
  predict(fit,
          newdata = data.frame(Horsepower = 250),
          interval = "confidence")
horse_predict

# Plot predicted mean on our graph
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Horsepower, MPG)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(data = cars, aes(Horsepower, predict(fit)), color = "indianred") +
  geom_point(aes(250, floor(horse_predict[1])),
             color = "steelblue",
             size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Predicting mean MPG for a car with 250 HP") +
  theme_ipsum()
```

# Let the user read in the data (the Beer Data.)

# Let the user make a histogram of the IBU

# Let the user make a histogram of the ABV  (separate histogram)

# Low the user switch back and forth between histograms and boxplots to
# represent this information.  You could do this with a radio button that
# switches the plot from histogram to boxplot â€¦ the implementation however is up
# to you.

# Allow the user to filter the histograms / boxplots above by state.

# In addition to the histograms, add a scatter plot of IBU v. ABV

# Add the ability to add or take off the simple linear regression line.

# Allow the user to filter the data on the scatter plot by state.

# Add at least one additional plot from your analysis and make sure to clearly
# label and/or describe the information it is conveying.

# Add the link to the tab you created for Case Study 1.

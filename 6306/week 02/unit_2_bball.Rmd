## Data Wrangling

```{r}
# Examine the data
glimpse(df)

# Split up positions
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(pos_f = str_detect(df$position, "F"),
         pos_g = str_detect(df$position, "G"),
         pos_c = str_detect(df$position, "C"))

# Convert height
df <- df %>% 
  separate(height, c('feet', 'inches'), "-", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(cm = (12*feet + inches)*2.54)
